  - MySQL database stores persistent data.

- **View (Frontend):**
  - Utilizes JSP pages and HTML for the user interface.
  - Responsive design ensures a seamless user experience.

- **Controller:**
  - Servlets manage the flow of data between the model and view.
  - Handles user requests, processes input, and invokes model methods.
